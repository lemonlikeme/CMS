		<p>The AGrS, together with the ACLC, complies with the Department of Education (DepEd). Fostering holistic Jesuit education, the lessons and activities are deepened through the Ignatian Pedagogical (IPP) that focuses on the components of Jesuit teaching and learning: context, experience, reflection, action, and evaluation. </p>
		<p>Inspired by the Ignatian Spirit of Adaptation, the Ateneo de Naga Grade School (AGrS) and the Ateneo Child Learning Center (ACLC) of the Basic Education unit recognize the need to respond to the challenges of the current health situation with thoughtful and intentional engagement. Further, as a learning institution dedicated to Cura Personalis (care of the whole person), the unit prioritizes the health and well-being of its learners and employees while continuing to educate them in the most feasible, efficient, and effective way possible.</p>
		<p>In the AteNEO Normal, the unit establishes a connection between the dynamic online community of Ateneo young learners and educators who are advanced models of the Profile of the Graduate and characterized by Cura Personalis.</p>
